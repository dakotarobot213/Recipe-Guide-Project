		<h1>Fluffy Pancake Recipe</h1>

		<h3>This recipe makes it easy to make delicous fluffy pancakes</h3>

		<h6>
			Random fun fact, Shakespeare apparently loved pancakes so much they often
			mentioned them in plays.

		<hr />

		<h1>Ingredients:</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>2 cups of all-purpose or plain flour (280g | 10 oz)</li>
			<li>1/4 cup of granulated sugar or sweetener, (60g | 2 oz)</li>
			<li>4 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1 3/4 cups milk (440ml)</li>
			<li>1/4 cup butter (60g | 2 oz)</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
			<li>1 large egg</li>
		</ul>

		<hr />

		<h1>Instructions:</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Combine the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and
				salt together within a large-sized bowl.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted
				butter, vanilla and egg.
			</li>
			<li>
				Wisk the mixture together before slowly folding them into the dry
				ingredients. Mix together until smooth it's (there may be a couple of
				lumps but that's okay).
			</li>
			<li>
				Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or
				griddle.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a
				little butter to lightly grease pan.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round
				shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.
			</li>
			<li>
				When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface,
				flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
			</li>
		</ol>
